## AI Commentary & Narration

The **Story Director** brings every match to life using advanced AI to generate a detailed, structured transcript of the action.

### Structured Transcript
Match narration is presented as a dialogue between the officiating **Narrator** and the **Commentary Team**:

*   **Narrator:** Provides objective, vivid descriptions of the wrestling moves, high spots, and key moments in the match.
*   **Commentators:** Offer character-driven analysis based on their unique personas.
    *   **Face Commentators:** Typically emphasize sportsmanship, technical skill, and the hero's journey.
    *   **Heel Commentators:** May justify rule-breaking, mock the underdogs, and offer controversial perspectives.

### Commentary Teams
Different shows can feature different commentary teams, each with their own chemistry and dynamic. The default **All-Time Broadcast Team** features:

*   **Dara Hoshiko:** An optimistic, analytical voice focusing on history and technique.
*   **Lord Bastian Von Crowe:** A theatrical, snarky color commentator who delights in the villainy of the squared circle.

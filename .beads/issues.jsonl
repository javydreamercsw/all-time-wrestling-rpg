{"id":"all-time-wrestling-rpg-5j1","title":"Fix AI rumors to be roster-aware","description":"Rumors generated by NewsGenerationService currently don't have roster context, leading to rumors about wrestlers not in the game. Update rollForRumor to pass a summary of the current roster to the AI.","notes":"Refined AI rumor generation to specifically use only the ACTIVE roster (using findAllByActiveTrue()). NPCs remain in scope. Added a new test case 'testRollForRumor_ExcludesInactiveWrestlers' to ensure retired or inactive wrestlers are not passed to the AI. All tests passed.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"javier.ortiz.78@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T19:55:29Z","created_by":"Javier A.

This needs to be refactored to use 'CampaignUpgrade' explicitly instead of 'var'.

# Specification: Wrestler Career Legacy & Hall of Fame

## Goal

Establish a persistent scoring and achievement system that tracks a wrestler's accomplishments across multiple seasons and handles retirement/legend status.

## Requirements

1. **Legacy Score Calculation:**
   - Develop a formula based on:
     - Days as champion (weighted by title prestige).
     - Number of 5-star matches (per narration feedback).
     - Main Event appearances.
     - Total Fans accumulated.
2. **Career Milestones:**
   - Track "First Time" achievements (e.g., Triple Crown Winner, Grand Slam).
3. **Retirement & Legends:**
   - Logic to transition active wrestlers into "Legends."
   - Legends provide buffs to their factions or apprentices.
4. **Hall of Fame UI:**
   - A dedicated "Hall of Fame" view displaying retired legends sorted by Legacy Score.

## Success Criteria

- Legacy Score is visible on the Wrestler Profile.
- Successful transition of a wrestler to "Legend" status.
- Hall of Fame displays historical records accurately.

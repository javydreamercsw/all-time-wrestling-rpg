# Interactive Promos Specification

## Overview

The goal is to make "Promo" segments interactive. When a player participates in a Promo segment, they should be able to type out their dialogue. The AI system will then generate a response (retort) from the perspective of the opponent(s) or an interviewer, taking into account wrestler personalities and active feuds.

## User Stories

1. **As a Player**, I want to input my promo text during a show segment so that I can roleplay my character.
2. **As a Player**, I want to receive an immediate response from my opponent generated by AI so that the promo feels dynamic.
3. **As a Booker**, I want to see the full transcript of the interactive promo in the show history.

## Functional Requirements

1. **UI Updates:**
   * Modify `MatchView` or create a new `PromoView` for segments with type "Promo".
   * Add a text input area for the user's promo.
   * Add a "Speak" or "Send" button.
   * Display the conversation history (chat style).
2. **Backend Updates:**
   * Update `SegmentNarrationService` or create `PromoService` to handle "interactive" generation.
   * The prompt should include:
     * The player's input text.
     * The opponent's personality (Face/Heel, Gimmick).
     * Context of the show/feud.
3. **Data Persistence:**
   * Store the full transcript in the `Segment` narration field (or a new field if needed).

## Technical Constraints

* Must support the existing LLM integration (Gemini/LocalAI).
* Latency should be minimized for a conversational feel.

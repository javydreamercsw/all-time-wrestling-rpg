# Product Guidelines

## Tone of Voice

The application's user interface and messaging should convey an **Enthusiastic & Engaging** tone. This vibrant and dynamic tone will immerse users in the exciting world of wrestling, making the experience more enjoyable and captivating. It should reflect the high energy, drama, and entertainment inherent in professional wrestling, encouraging users to actively participate and explore all aspects of the game.

## User Feedback and Community Interaction

The application should primarily handle user feedback and community interaction through a **Forum-Based Community Hub**. This approach leverages existing community platforms, such as an external forum or a dedicated Discord server, for discussions, suggestions, and support. This reduces the development overhead for in-app social features and allows users to engage in a familiar and often more robust social environment. It encourages a vibrant community outside the application itself, where users can share their experiences, strategies, and creative content.

## Visual Aesthetic and User Experience (UX) Design Principles

The visual aesthetic and user experience (UX) of the application should be guided by **Wrestling-Themed & Immersive** principles. This involves incorporating elements reminiscent of classic wrestling aesthetics, arenas, and broadcasts to enhance immersion. The design should leverage the rich visual language of professional wrestling to create an authentic and engaging environment for users. This includes, but is not limited to, thematically appropriate color schemes, typography, iconography, and layout designs that evoke the excitement and drama of a wrestling event. The goal is to reinforce the core theme and appeal directly to the target audience's nostalgia and interest, making the game feel deeply connected to the world of professional wrestling.

## Brand Identity

The All Time Wrestling RPG should establish a **Gritty & Realistic** brand identity. This approach will emphasize a more grounded, simulation-focused representation of professional wrestling. The branding should reflect the intense, competitive, and strategic aspects of the sport, appealing to users who appreciate depth, authenticity, and realism in their simulation games. This means a focus on believable outcomes, detailed mechanics, and a less fantastical portrayal of the wrestling world.

## Quality Standards and Benchmarks

The project should adhere to the following quality standards for its software and content:

*   **Robust & Reliable:** Prioritize stability, minimal bugs, and consistent performance across all features. This is essential for a simulation game to ensure a smooth and trustworthy user experience, minimizing frustration and maximizing player engagement.
*   **Engaging & Dynamic:** Ensure that AI narrations and game events are consistently interesting, varied, and captivating. This directly impacts user retention and satisfaction in a storytelling-driven game, making sure the generated content feels fresh and exciting with each playthrough.
*   **Secure & Trustworthy:** Implement best practices for data security, user privacy, and protection against exploits. This is critical for any application handling user data and online interactions, building user confidence and protecting against potential vulnerabilities.
